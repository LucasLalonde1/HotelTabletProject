# HotelTablet Project

## There are 3 directories in this project...

1. **hoteltablet**: This directory contains the code for a mobile application designed for in-room tablets. It allows hotel guests to communicate directly with the front desk and access detailed hotel information. The app currently includes a live chat feature and can be expanded to include service requests or other guest services.

2. **hoteladmin**: This directory contains the code for a React-based web application used by hotel staff. At present, it primarily includes a chat interface for communication between the front desk and the in-room tablets.

3. **backend**: This directory contains the backend API, built using Django, which handles all requests from both the front desk and the tablets.

**venv**: This is a Python virtual environment for the backend API. It contains all the required dependencies for the backend to run smoothly.
